title: Accessible Horizons Welcomes its First and Very Special Guest - Yazmine Laroche
podcastDate: 2025-05-30
episode: 5
longDescription: >-
  In this episode, we dive into the heart of accessibility innovation at the
  Government of Canada, beginning with a tour of the client space at AAACT. This
  is where clients can experience firsthand adaptive technology and collaborate
  with AAACT technicians to find personalized solutions for removing barriers.




  In the second segment, we explore the *Social Model of Disability*, a powerful framework that emphasizes that instead of focusing on fixing the individual, it is the environment that needs to change to remove barriers and promote inclusion. This perspective encourages a more inclusive approach in both workplaces and communities.




  To close the episode, we speak with Yazmine Laroche, the former Deputy Minister of the Office of Public Service Accessibility. Yazmine shares her proudest achievements from her time in government, emphasizes how one person truly can make a difference, and discusses her current work focused on driving inclusion. Her journey is a testament to the power of leadership in creating meaningful change.

Intro
Welcome to Accessible Horizons, a podcast series about how to build a barrier free and inclusive public service. Join your hosts. Accessibility experts Nadine Charron and Luna Bengio from the Accessibility, Accommodation and Adaptive Computer Technology (AAACT) program for a lively discussion and lots of practical tips.

Nadine
Good afternoon everyone. Sorry. We're a couple of minutes late.

I think technical difficulties is the name of the game today. Hi, Luna. How are you?

Luna
Good afternoon everyone. Hi, Nadine. It's again an immense pleasure to be here. This is episode five. Did you think when we started we would get to episode five? No. I'm so excited.

Nadine
I didn't know that people were going to watch us. And I thought we were living out our own dream. But it's so nice to bring people along. So, you know, I started the meeting. We were a minute late. All these technological difficulties make my life,
more difficult. But, let's start again. I'm Nadine.

Luna
And I am Luna. And welcome to Accessible Horizons. Welcome to this very special episode for National Accessibility Week. We are almost at the end of the week. I hope everyone had an opportunity to celebrate what national accessibility brings us, which is the opportunity to recognize the contribution of people with disabilities in our society. And today we have an incredible episode for you.

Let's do these technology, help us and cooperate, because our episode brings our very first guest to Accessible Horizons. So, Nadine, tell us a little bit more about that.

Nadine
Well, was, it was a dream to bring on someone. It's always nice to be working just with you, but we thought maybe people would like to see other people that have accessibility at heart, similar to what we do and in the way that we have it as well. So we so if you've seen my post on LinkedIn, you know who our special guest is, but you know her more than I do.

So I'm going to let you introduce her.

Luna
I've had the honour, the privilege and the pleasure to work with her twice in my federal public service career. The last one was in her role as the first deputy minister responsible for accessibility in the Federal Public Service. She was appointed in that role in 2018. And her name, of course, is Yazmine Laroche She had very kindly agreed to give us to tell us about her career, about her proud moment, and about the fantastic things she's doing today.

Nadine
Yes, it was an honour to, to be working with her and, you know, and you'll see it in the video because we had to pre pre-taped the interview. So we'll be showing that,
shortly. And it was a fangirl moment for me to be in both of your presence. And I hope it didn't show too much.

And you guys can tell me in the video later. But it was it was so much fun to do. And it also opens up some doors for our next, podcast, because we're going to keep bringing in guests that are going to showcase some of the things that they're doing with accessibility, and we're hoping that we're going to see some innovation and some changes.

But let's focus on this week. Luna, you and I participated in many different, occasions this week, and we were asked to be guest speakers. And so we want to thank the organizers of all these meetings to reach out to us. And it was so fun to do. And I know you and I did some mostly together, but we did some, individually as well.

So I'm going to start with mine because I started, I was invited to the Canada School event, with OPSA and I know you've listened to me, so I know if I say guess what I talked about, you're going to be able to answer. But if you haven't seen it, I got to talk about Rossy. So Rossy was our dog that we had from Mira that spent a year with us.

And guess what? She now has graduated. But we have a new dog called Laurier and he is absolutely beautiful. So I'm hoping that Sophie and Laurier will be on one of our future podcasts.

Luna
Oh, I can't wait.

Nadine
And I also got the opportunity to talk about the passport. So those were,
one of the ones that I did this week. And you and I, provided some culture train culture change training, which was really fun because we've learned so much from our participants because the participation was out of this world. People had comments, questions, and they answered questions for us.

And we learned from them. So interactivity in these kind of sessions is my favourite way to do things. And hopefully we'll bring back some of the examples of what we learned. This week.



Luna
Will definitely in in a few minutes. We had an opportunity to collaborate with the,
kind of Canadian Center for Innovation in Mental Health in the workplace and to talk about digital accessibility. We talked about culture change. As you indicated, we were on different panels, including the opening ceremony for ISED so Innovation, Science and Economic Development this time I've got it right.

In, their opening ceremony talking about life experiences and how they shape a career and how they shape your perspective. So lots of great, great activities this week. We also had a very special activity as well, which was a trivia contest.

Nadine
And so and so if you stay till the end of our podcast, after the interview with Yazmine we'll be doing a draw for everyone that participated. So first and foremost, I want to thank all of you who signed up and participated because we started on Monday with a smaller number of participants and it grew all week. And the other person we have to thank is Genevieve.

Genevieve on the team answered every one of those emails individually, providing correct answers or giving kudos for the people who had gotten the right answers. So thank you for participating and thanks Genevieve for doing so much work. So on, Luna's left hand side of the table, you will see the water bottle that we will draw at the end of the podcast, and we will send it to the winner.

And luckily enough, we did the draw in the French podcast and the person who won was actually in attendance. So we'll be sending that to her, shortly.

Luna
Absolutely. It is a great opportunity to share a bit of knowledge and in a in a different manner with, colleagues across the Federal public service. But today, we are here in one of the areas in our 219 Laurier in Ottawa, space and it is the client space. It is where we have already had the opportunity to welcome many people who would like to explore the great, the great devices and tools.

I was going to say the gadgets because I call them all gadgets. Right.

Nadine
But such a gadget queen.

Luna
But they are not all gadgets, and some of them are so creative that I can still marvel at them. So tell us a little bit more about this space Nadine this space.

Nadine
We kept it special for this event. We wanted to wait for National Accessibility Week to really reveal, because it is a lot of hard work that went into this space to welcome clients so they can try out a lot of the different tools or an adaptive technology that we have here. And the ability to try and stay here for the day.

Working with a technician to find the right solution has been really beneficial for many people so far. So I'm going to describe it a little bit. And then we'll see if there's we'll answer some questions about how we actually work in this space. So as we've have told you before, and if you looked at all of our different podcasts, so behind me you'll see the biggest place and you'll see different, that demonstrate equipment.

And we'll see the tables that are behind me that go up and down. And on there you'll see the CCTVs or the magnifier that we call them. We have Celeste sitting on that table on the, display case. We have a different mice and keyboards, cameras, 3D printed equipment. So a lot of the things that we've showcased previously in the Lending Library portion of our podcast are now here on display, something that you don't see physically here because we're live.

We will see in the podcast. When I do release, it is in front of me. There are four desks, and to that right hand side there are four more desks. There's eight desks total for clients that can come in and look at equipment and try it out at those desk. We have different chairs, different keyboards, and every single one of those desks also has a different monitor so people can try them out.

Because sometimes trying out a mouse for 30s in a store and we think, oh yeah, this is good, and you spend a whole day with it and you figure out, oh, my wrist is sore, my hand is sore. This is not the right configuration for me. So while working with the technician, you can actually slot out that specific equipment and try something new.

So we have X keys. We have mice, we have keyboards, we have monitors and we have a variety of different tools that we use that we've talked about in the Lending Library.

Luna
So so it's Paradise for people who love gadgets. Let me tell you, I'm going to ask you one quick question about this client space. So I'm an employee in the Federal public service and I'm interested in coming and exploring some of these solutions. What can I do?

Nadine
You can call me. No, no, you can consider the inbox. So we do have an inbox. And once you tell us what you need, you'll be assigned a technician. And then you will get a booking to come into this space at your convenience. The technician will be here with you and to be able to support you while you try out different things.

We do have certain tools that are out almost all of the time, and then we make sure that when there's a client that has a specific need, that we actually bring out the equipment that they would be trying that day. So we swap out the equipment regularly so people see different things. And then when you visit that we do have people come visit and we try and make those changes so that people are not always seeing the same thing.

And what's gratifying for me is as soon as people go through the door and enter this space, they are so drawn to our display cases that they end up asking questions, playing with the equipment, which is exactly why this space was built.

Luna
And it is really the result of a lot of work on the part of many people in the Accessibility, Accommodation and Adaptive Computer Technology team.

All I can say is not only will you find a lot of gadgets, but you will find a lot of welcoming people who smile, and whose goal is to help is to find the right solutions so that the client, the employee or their manager knows that the work situation is going to be addressed and the barriers will be mitigated or eliminated.

And that's wonderful to know.

Nadine

We have many solutions and we're very, very happy to try them out with you. So let us know when you want to come and visit and when you'd like to work with one of our technicians. And we'll make it happen for sure.

Luna
For sure. So we can we move to talk about basically what this space really embodies. Like, for me, it really is a direct physical reality of what we talk about when we talk about the social model of disability. And, you know, we often start some of our, our training by saying, I don't need to be fixed and I don't need to be fixed because I am not the problem, or you are not the problem or any of our, 
you know, spectators or listeners who have a disability.

They're not the problem. The problem is in our environment. And that's what the social model really promotes. It promotes the the fact that it's the interaction between an individual and an environment that often riddled with barriers. And therefore we need to find solutions. This is what this space is about. We talked about that. We talked about the the variety of solutions.

And there are, I think, thousands of them. We cannot count how many there are. You know, the sky's the limit when it comes to finding creative solutions that can help people do their job. So this this social model is that. And we cannot see it in more of its reality than we see it in this client space.



Nadine

Sure. When people come in here, we don't ask them what their diagnosis is. We talk about their barriers and we talk about solutions. That's all we do. And once we create that environment that is free of that discrimination and that medical model, I don't need a medical. note. You don't tell you don't need to tell me that you have ADHD.

You can tell me what you need and what your barriers are. So we'll look at solutions, whether they are gadgets that you, as you call them earlier, or adaptive technology, as we normally call it. Yes. Or it could be, software that's going to help you. And sometimes it can be as low tech as, you know, putting a dot on a keyboard or doing something different.

So we really address the barrier and we leave the medical model at home because it is not important to us. I don't need to be fixed, but I can fix my environments so that I can work better. But wait, do you remember this week we had so many good questions and there's one question I want to ask you because it came up a couple of times.

And here's my question, because I'm sure you can answer it, is, you know, some jobs require me to figure out what paint colour I need to put on the walls, and I need to know what colour that is before I can actually put it on the wall. Because, you know, if it was up to you and me, guess what?

We'd put on the walls?

Nadine
Blue.

You definitely put blue.

So you mean I can splash the walls with whatever I want?

Well, usually in a government building, when we put paint on the wall, it has to be decided in advance, and we end up buying the paint. So how do I know? Or how do you know that you're putting the right colour on the wall?

Luna
Well, first of all, I think it's important to recognize that, yeah, there are certain jobs that are going to create challenges that none of our gadgets or measures are going to be able to resolve. I won't be driving Nadine's Jeep tomorrow. And that's that's really painful. But it is true, right? However, I think that we need to be open.

We need to think about creative solutions. We need to think about what is out there that can create the environments so that people can do their job. And, you know, nowadays with artificial intelligence, I can tell you what the colour of the paint is. And it it the our world is evolving. And I'm not saying technology or AI will resolve will address every barrier.

But definitely we are progressing. We are much further than we were even five years ago in terms of solutions in the workplace. So the the key is to keep an open mind and to not see the limits, but to see the possibilities. It sounds very cliche, but it's true.

Nadine
It's it it might be cliche, but it really is fitting for our guest today. And she did not,
she was one that broke barriers while she was here. So why don't we get to that interview we did with her? So you can learn a little bit more about her and what she's up to, and some of her proudest moments while she worked here.

Luna
Let's welcome Yazmine LaRoche to Accessible Horizons.

Welcome. We have the pleasure today to welcome our very first guests to Accessible Horizons and it is National Accessibility Week. So it's a particularly important time of the year. Our very special guest is Yazmine Laroche. Yazmine was the first deputy minister of public service accessibility. I should say the only deputy minister of public service accessibility. And I have to say, I had the privilege and the honour to be part of Yazmine's team twice in my career, and the last one was during her tenure as a deputy.

So, Yazmine welcome to Accessible Horizons and it is an honour to have you here today. Here today.

Yazmine
Well, thank you so much for inviting me, Luna and Nadine. I'm so, so happy to be here. And I'm thrilled to be your first guest.

Luna
Absolutely. We we couldn't have picked any other one for sure. So we'd like to start off with a little bit of more recent information about where you are these days and what you're doing, and I know you're on the board of the disability screen,  or office. Is that how it's called?

Nadine
That's what it's called.

Luna
Can you tell us a little bit about it? I'm very intrigued.

Yazmine
Well, I'm, I am actually the chair of the board, the inaugural chair of a brand new startup, although it's a little less brand new now. But it launched. We launched officially on, on International Day of People with disabilities,

in December of 2022. That was our formal launch. It was created by a couple of organizations, including Accessible Media Incorporated.

There was, there was a recognition that there's a huge gap in the Canadian screen industry. And by screen, I'm talking about film and broadcasting, primarily and streaming as well. Now that that is covered under the Broadcasting Act, that there was a gap in terms of, advocacy and awareness raising about all the barriers that exist in, in this really important sector of our economy and a really important sector of our cultural identity.

And there are two big issues. One is that there are barriers to actual participation by people with disabilities. And secondly. We don't see ourselves. We don't hear ourselves. There is very little representation of people, with living with disabilities in the screen industry in Canada. And so the Disability Screening Office was created with kind of that twofold mandate, one, to increase representation, but as importantly, to remove the barriers to participation because there are so many barriers, built into this industry.

So the last few years have been very, very interesting. I've never been involved with a startup before. I, we could we could say that the, public service that OPSA the Office of Public Service Accessibility was a start up, but in, in the sense of actually growing, an organization that's national, that's bilingual, that's actually trying to transform an industry.

So it, so chairing that or it is, is a joy. It's also a lot of work. And I'm very fortunate that I've got other great people on the board, and we've got some superb staff.

We hired our, our CEO in 2023, and, we hired a few more staff this year, and we're doing some very, very interesting work.

Luna, you're going to laugh when I tell you this, because, you know, when we were doing the, accessibility strategy that we said, you have to start with data, you have to build the evidence. And of course, one of the first things that I realized, when I joined the organization is that there's very little data about representation and participation of people with disabilities in this industry.

And so we have launched, a huge research initiative to actually try and build, a really good evidence case and a database as well. So, and we thought we've actually got a survey that's live right now. So I can actually promote this. Please Google disability screen office.

And you will find, on our link, you'll find a link to the survey.

We're really encouraging anybody who's currently in the industry or anybody who wants to join the industry. So you guys, your podcast.

Luna

Oh, absolutely.

Yazmine

Maybe you want to maybe you would like to fill out our survey and talk about barriers and talk about hopes and dreams. It will really, really help us. So there's my plug for the DSO.

Luna
Excellent Fantastic. That is great. And yes, we are, you know, on our fifth episode of a podcast, we won't pretend that we are very professional at this yet, but it's fantastic to know that there's the opportunity to be part of that industry as well. Excellent. Thank you. Nadine did you have a question?

Nadine
I always have questions, you know, that. So I love the fact that you talked about OPSA as a startup, because it sort of goes full circle to what you're doing now. So tell us a little bit about what your proudest moment was. At OPSA If you have one favourite or if you have many favourites.

Yazmine
Have so many I don't, I don't know, I don't know where to start or where to end.

You know, I will go back to pre OPSA actually, and talk about the amazing work that, that, the network of champions and chairs, public servants with disabilities did in actually creating a bit of a roadmap and a blueprint for what an accessible public service might be like.

And, and the reason I signal that it was at the time I was at Infrastructure Canada, and I was the DM champion for public servants with disabilities. And, it was such an amazing community with so much knowledge and insight and to be able to have done this two day design thinking workshop and come out of it with a really strong blueprint that I delivered to the Clerk, and as a result of which he asked me to to take on the job of Deputy Minister of Public Service Accessibility.

So that was the power of the community, actually able to drive change at the very most senior levels. So that's kind of number one, super proud because it was a fantastic, report. And it and it really helped launch and the work that we did, of course, building the great team and making sure that we had great, people with lived experience to help drive the initiative.

I'm really, really proud of the, of the approach that we took, which was truly built on nothing without us. And the fact that we built from the ground up by listening by by just being and make the listening mode for six months to hear about the realities of the lives of public servants with disabilities, we looked at best practices around the world.

And but we also engaged with the senior most level. So my Deputy Minister Advisory Group, so proud of that community because these were people actually had all the levers and the power to make a difference, to change policies, to implement programs. We had the right people sitting around the table. So when you have great input from the people with lived experience experiencing the barriers, and then on the other hand, you have the people who actually own the solutions or the the ability to implement the solutions.

That's when the magic starts to happen. And I think when I look at some of the, successes that we had around changes to procurement policy, changes to the way we at the of course, Luna, you know, where I'm going.

You know, the accessibility passport.

Luna
Yeah.

Yazmine
You know, understanding what the biggest pain point was and were really driving to make a change there. So I, you know, I do we get everything done? Of course not. This kind of change as somebody a wise person, a person much wiser than I am said it, it takes a long time. But I think the combination of being able to raise awareness to be relentless in our focus and to constantly put our communities first and make sure that this was about them and was with them as well, I think, that's, you know, so those are some of my mega, moments of pride and the ability to work with just a phenomenal group of people.

You know, when you're when you're all committed to a cause and to, to making positive change happen. Well, is it ever exciting to go to work every day? It is.

Nadine
That's how we feel coming to work every day, for sure. And you said some. So some wonderful things there, the accessibility strategy. And of course, we would be remiss if we didn't mention AAACT as being part of that accessibility strategy, which is one of the reasons we keep going and come to work every day. And then, you know, nothing without us.

It's so, so, so important. And in the passport, I'm sure Luna can tell you where we're at with the passport. But it's been a very exciting journey since I've been here in the last two years, and I'm glad you guys started it, because it's going to, soon happen in a broader sense, right? Luna?

Luna
Absolutely. The digital version is coming, I'm told, this summer, so it will become a reality. I have to also remind our audience that we keep on quoting you all the time.,Yazmine. I mean, because you co-wrote, the, actual use of the acquisition card in, in securing easy and fast, accommodation tools for employees with disabilities.

You co authored that, little communique with the Comptroller General at the time and it is has made a difference for many, many people. So that's one of the very many lasting impacts that you've had on, on this, on this community and on the accessibility in the public service. So what would you say with your obviously hindsight today and what you are observing?

Would be, the, the biggest progress we've made, but also where we still have work to do as a public service.

Yazmine
Well, there's always work to do as a public service, isn't there, because there are so many challenges. But in terms of, where I think the public service is at right now, I think excessive, it's less about awareness raising now. I think we spent a lot of time at the beginning just raising awareness about why this matters and why this is important.

And I my hope is that we're beyond that now. And it's now about implementation and, kind of continuing to focus on so what are the remaining barriers and what more do we need to do? But I think the fact that we were able to describe what the issue was and to help people measure their progress on it, I think it helps you to it helps with the continuance of the work then, because you're kind of developing, a way of doing something that is harder to undo because it starts to get wired into just how people do things.

And of course, having the Accessible Canada Act, as the overarching umbrella and framework for this is really helpful because public service is subject to the ACA and has to report on how well it's doing annually on it. So I think these are this is going to make it stick.

So, and I think we have enough people now who are driving this.

And I'll just tell you a little anecdote. So I was at, an event at the National Arts Center last week, and in that and, and I was waiting for a Para Transpo to come and pick me up afterwards. And I was in the lobby and over the course of 20 minutes, I ran into two people I'd met when I was involved with OPSA and both of them told me what they were doing in their current jobs to help advance accessibility. And, and, and these are so these are strong allies working in two different organizations, he said. Yeah. One of them said, I was working in the DEI team in a particular department, and it was dissolved. So now I'm in another department and I'm not in a DEI role, but I'm still doing everything I can to advance accessibility and inclusion.

And for me, that was so powerful because this is this is one individual saying Okay, I get it. I was you know, I know what this means. I know why this is important. And I am continuing to work in this. And for me, that's super powerful and super encouraging.

Luna

Absolutely. It is continuing. And there are voices out there that are continuing to amplify the message. Absolutely. Nadine, I'll turn it over to you for one more question.



Nadine
Oh, one more question. I was going to do, I was going to do one comment on that. And, it's interesting because this will air only on the Friday after my appearance at the School, which will be on the Monday National Accessibility Week. And one of the things that we talked about, if you've listened to that part, is how one person can make a difference.

It only takes one voice, and it doesn't have to be a deputy minister. It doesn't have to be an ADM We all have a voice in to make that voice heard. Like, I love the anecdote because if we all have a voice and we all use it, things would be so much different.

So which is great. So, when it comes to questions, there's so many I'd love to be able to ask you, but we do have a time constraint. So is there anything that you'd love to tell us that, you know, without us asking about, you know, things that we can do or looking at the better accommodation project, if you've heard of that or anything that we can do better different, especially now with your new role and our role of podcasting.

Is there any anecdotes from that part of your life that you'd like to share?

Yazmine
I think the only thing I would say is that the universe is always evolving. And one of the things and so I'm always learning about new accessibility barriers and new challenges to accessibility, and that can sometimes seem a little bit daunting. But I think it's also an opportunity because the more we learn, the more we engage, the better we can make things for everybody.

And so, for example, I just joined the board of the Ottawa International Airport Authority. And so this is a huge learning curve for me. It's really, really interesting. But I'm also the first person with a physical disability to join their board. So this is a huge learning opportunity for them as well. And and and so we are learning together and I think this is again, I for me this is a positive to, to to go into a new environment to meet, to interact with new people and to and to go on this journey together where they're starting to realize, oh, maybe the way we've been doing things aren't as if inclusive as they could be. So again, this gets back, Nadine to what you were saying, how one individual can make a difference. And so never underestimate your power, either as somebody with lived experience of disability or somebody who just wants to learn more and make a difference, and one person can make a huge, huge difference.

You know, my favorite story? And, before we run out of time about the the power of one individual, all was, was how I the when I finally felt like I actually belonged in the public service and I was in ADM by this time, and I had repeatedly, over a course of three years, declined an invitation by a former deputy minister to go to their, Christmas gathering for senior executives. And I just made excuses because the their house was not accessible. I couldn't get into it. And I didn't want to I didn't want I don't want them. I didn't want them to feel bad. And so I just, you know, oh, I got guests Oh I'm sorry, I've got other plans. So I was the no show for three years in a row. Then we got a new deputy minister and who, wanted to continue with the tradition. And for some reason, I just felt more courage with this person. And I said, I don't think I can attend because I can't get into your house because there are steps to get into your house.

And they said, what? Let me look into this. And they rented two ramps so that I could get up their stairs. And, and they and they and they said it as if it was it was just, well, why wouldn't I? And of course, we want you there. And one person, one person doing one thing that made me feel for the first time that I actually fully belonged in the public service of Canada.

So again, I love what you said Nadine because to me, it's not one person who is going to change everything, but one person can change something. And if a whole lot of individuals work on that, then we can change every.

Nadine
That's definitely true. That ripple effect is huge. And Luna reminds me every day that I'm supposed to ask her how can I support you today.

Luna
And and not and not tell me about the water fountain every time.

Nadine
And if you if you seen our first podcast, the water fountain is a big thing.

Luna
And it's become a big thing, I again conscious of time, but I want to share one thing, that I found was a real learning for me. While I had the privilege of working with OPSA and you were the deputy minister, and it was that you always said, I don't want to do everything. I don't want OPSA to be the be all.

And end all for accessibility in the public service. I want each organization to feel that they have a role to play, that they have a responsibility, and each with their own mandate can make a difference. And I think that I will return retain that lesson from from what the influence you had on the public service, which is a huge influence, that is felt to this day.

I think your name resonates with so many people.

Yazmine
Thank you. That's so sweet. So kind of.

Luna
Like I was.

Also true. It's also true. It's. I mean, it's why we took the approach that we did, and we had all the key players around the table, and we held them accountable, and we kind of deputized them to get out there and do what they could in their own sphere of influence. And and that's how it happens. That's how you that's how you succeed.

Because you're right. One tiny little group of people, if that's it, if that's if that's your hope for salvation and change, then you're not going to get there. So you really, really need to, you need to motivate and, and in French responsabilisé others.

Luna
Yes, absolutely. Well, I know I could go on with this conversation for a very, very long time. And I know Nadine would to, we could definitely absorb a lot of the wisdom that you have to impart. We could also ask you tons of other questions about the rest of the things that you do, which seem fascinating.

You are on the, board of the NAC. You are on the advisory committee or advisory group for the Auditor general. And I'm sure a lot of other, activities. Yazmine, we want to thank you so much for being with us today, for agreeing to experiment with us, having a guest on the podcast. And we want to wish all of our audience happy National Accessibility Week . Nadine last words.

I'm going to mix up all the names, Luna and I'm going to have you draw it so that I can read out the name. How's that? Cool let’s do that. Like, I know this is making noise for the mics and everything. I apologize, but I do have to mix them.

So are you ready?
